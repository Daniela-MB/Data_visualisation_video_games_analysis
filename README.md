## Introduction

In this project is created a ficticius scenario in which a retail company needs to analyze a video game dataset to inform their sales strategy, accompanied by a distinct, clear visualization, all created using Python.

## Objective
To analyze video game sales and releases, derive actionable insights, and develop a range of visualizations to enhance stakeholders' understanding and support informed decision-making

## Dataset

The dataset on video game usage and releases from 1980 to 2020. 

## Project execution

- *Data Engineering*: Cleaned data, ensured correct data types, and created necessary features (e.g., game age).
  
- *Visualization Choices*:

  -  Bar Chart: Used for visualizing quantities across categories with horizontal bars to quickly convey data ranks.
  -  Scatterplot: Chosen to show the correlation between North American and Japanese sales, making it easy to interpret correlations.
  -  Dot Plot & Violin Plot: A dot plot was used to display the top 4 genres, while a violin plot illustrated their distribution and trends over time, offering an alternative to traditional histograms.
  -  Grouped Bar Chart: Selected to compare mean and median values for two different periods, facilitating direct comparison and clarity in summary statistics.
  -  Word Cloud: Employed to represent the frequency of words, highlighting the proportion of 'Unknown' data effectively.
  -  Strip Plot: Utilized to compare 'Platform' categories without overlap, showing distribution and sales data clearly while adding visual variety.

- *Design Decisions for Visualizations*: Considering an audience of CTOs aged 35 to 60 who favor clear and straightforward visuals, I focused on large, legible text and high-contrast colors to enhance readability. The design features a consistent blue color palette, uniform font style and size, and standardized titles placed centrally at the top to convey information efficiently.

 
## Results and Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the company should invest in PS3, X360, PS4, 3DS, and Wii consoles, and focus on popular titles such as Grand Theft Auto V and the Call of Duty series. Additionally, further research is needed to identify the best games for the 3DS and Wii to maximize sales opportunities. However, note that this analysis is based on data up to 2020, and recent developments in consoles and games may have shifted current consumer preferences.
